          As you can probably tell, I don't actually have a blog (yet). I tend to have strong opinions across my interests, such as iOS vs Android. Small preview: I primarily use iOS, but both have some very strong pros and cons. Some day that's the type of thing I will write about here, probably through another platform that allows me to embed posts in a presentable fashion.
